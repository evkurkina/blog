## Overview

1. Static sites are popular for many reasons. The elimination of redundant solutions and the simplicity of the project with no databases, too many dependencies, or certain server-side configurations (no PHP, no MySQL/MSSQL, .NET, Python, Ruby, etc.) make it very easy to deploy and robust against numerous possible vulnerabilities. Ultimately, they become simple HTML pages that are presented to the user.

2.  KISS's legendary design acronym - Keep It Simple, Stupid - can be applied to Hugo and how it approaches the static website generator space.

Embedded in Go, Hugo compiles your static pages quickly (it takes a fraction of a millisecond to compile a small site - and can do thousands of pages in seconds).

In addition, Hugo provides essential tools for a website's static workflow (including deployment and migration tools), allowing developers and designers to focus on the fun details, such as showing their creativity and bringing out said creativity when building a website.

 
3. When we create content websites, we can assume some common features for all sites, and Hugo provides a framework for just that. In particular, we can take content types such as posts, categories, reviews, or products and arrange the data. We can then give each one a specific look through templates and style sheets.

Moving forward, we can really route it anywhere within the static space of an HTML/CSS/JS website. When you think about it pragmatically, it's a big space, allowing for a lot of room for creativity.

jQuery will work just fine and there's nothing stopping you from using third party services on your static page if you need them. So don't limit yourself thinking that you can't integrate other libraries or applications into your static sites. It really isn't - you can use any of the available JavaScript libraries.

So for multiple pages of a company type website with a link to a Google form for the "Contact Us" page. And if you need to display other types of data, you can use JavaScript for that aspect of your site.
